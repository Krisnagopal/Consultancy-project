<h1> Google BI Project </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This consultancy project has been completed as a requirement in the Business Research & Consultancy course in my MSc program at the University of Groningen. Here, I worked as a junior consultant in a team of four(04) students for an external company under the supervision of course coordinators. We worked as consultants for the Groningen City Club (GCC) to help them finding optimum solutions for a problem situation. The problem was centered around the Groningen City Retailers who have been struggling in their businesses in the post-pandemic period. So we needed to identify the reasons behind them first and then propose a few potential solutions to get them out of that struggling phase. It was a research-based consultancy project which we, the team of four junior consultants, completed successfully.

<h2>Research Methods (What we did)</h2>

- <b>Collecting background information about the GCC and the context of the retail sector in Groningen and its stakeholders.  </b>
- <b>Working with the client (through several intake meetings) to choose a sample of streets and retailers for detailed research. Then, interviewing those retailers to understand their problems and opportunities. The interviews were scheduled as long as the retailers were available and willing to participate.  </b>
- <b>After gathering all the interview data, analyzing those carefully to find patterns, insights, and possible solutions. Our objective was to discover factors behind the downfall of physical sales -decreased footfall, consumer behavior, retailers' choices, the lack of cooperation among the retailers etc.  </b>
- <b>Based on thorough analysis, providing practical suggestions via a final advice report to the GCC to help retailers to increase their physical sales and thrive in their businesses.  </b>
